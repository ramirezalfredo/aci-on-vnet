# aci-on-vnet

This is a quick example of Azure Container Instance on a new VNet using the Azure SDK for Java.

To run this example:

```sh
mvn clean compile exec:java
```

This is entirely based on: [Azure Resource Manager Container Instance client library for Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/azure-resourcemanager-containerinstance_2.6.0/sdk/resourcemanager/azure-resourcemanager-containerinstance/)
